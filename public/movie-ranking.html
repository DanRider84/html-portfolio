    <h1>The Best Movies According to Dan</h1>
    <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>Interstellar</h3>
    <p>Interstellar is an incredible movie about a NASA mission to find a habitable planet beyond the solar system. It is so well thought out and absolutely blew my mind. Not only do
        the actors put on an exceptional performance, but the sound and the visual effects really brought this movie together to create a masterpiece. I am fascinated by black holes 
        and astrophysics generally, so with this as a key feature of the storyline, I was heavily sucked in (no pun intended).</p>
    <h3>Avengers: Endgame</h3>
    <p>I'm a big Marvel fan, so it is hard to narrow it down to one movie in the Marvel "Universe". However, this is movie is just pure brilliance as it features all of the Marvel 
        superheroes from the previous movies, such as Iron Man, Captain America and of course, the Incredible Hulk, smashing everything in his path! The action and special effects really 
        make this movie and has a really emotional, yet satisfying ending, as the heroes finally defeat the dreaded villain, Thanos.</p>
    <h3>The Godfather: Part 2</h3>
    <p>This classic from Francis Ford Coppola is my favourite mafia/gangster movie of all time and, in my opinion, the best one out of the Godfather trilogy. 
        It stars Al Pacino as 'Michael Corleone' and the next chapter of his journey, having been made head of the Corleone family, following the death of his father, Vito in the first 
        Godfather movie.</p>
        <p>What makes this movie stand out for me is the story it also shows of the story of 
        the young Vito Andolini (Michael's father), played by Robert De Niro and how he started as a young orphan immigrant in New York City and rose to become the Godfather and head of 
        the Corleone family, aptly named after his hometown. There are several scenes filmed in Sicily, as well as 'Little Italy' in New York City, which provide a lot of authenticity to 
        the movie. Vito eventually returns to Sicily to avenge the death of his parents, having fled the country as a child to escape his own inevitable death from his parent's killer, 
        Don Fanucci.</p>
